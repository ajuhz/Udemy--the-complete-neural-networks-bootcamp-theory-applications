# Udemy : The complete neural networks bootcamp theory applications
This repository contains the Hands-on files which has been described or referenced in the course.

# Neural Network using Numpy
Open Item
1. Why the network is not learing/ learning very slow when number of layers increases?

#Practical NN using Pytorch : Digit recognition
Things to explore in the solution:
1. Changing the initialization from HE to other technique or random initialize
2. Data preprocessing to normalize the dataset
3. Applying different Optimizers and see the training behavior and performance
4. applying sigmoid to the last layer
5. applying tanh instead of relu to the hidden layers
6. In pytorch how backprop works? Loss and optimizer how linked? Jupyter notebook updated
